### Welcome to my repositary for the manuscript "2023 Canadian Foreign Buyer Ban: Price Dynamics in Big vs. Small Cities"
### The latest version of the manuscript is always at the main folder under the name "Manuscript [date version]"
### If you are interested, you can found my code and cleaned data used for the regression underth replication code & data folder. 
### I am still updating the data preparation process at the preparation folder. Unfortunately, I learned the great guide “Gentzkow M and Shapiro JM (2014) Code and data for the social sciences: A practitioner's guide” later after completing this project. Therefore, some intermediate steps were not saved by the time I created them. I would like to enhance them a bit later. Or with my future projects.
### Thank you for your interest in my research. If you have any questions, feel free to contact kyi.fan@mail.utoronto.ca
